# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I would really like to expand upon the keyframes animation feature that we learned about in this project. I feel like it would really open up the page more if a little extra animation was added to the beggining of the landing page. Otherwise it looks pretty good!
